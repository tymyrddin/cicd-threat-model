# Source code

ANY CI/CD solution can probably be compromised if an attacker has access to the source code.

Source stage (Commit stage) is where new features and new code are integrated with the base code. 
It can trigger the CI/CD pipeline by changes to the code repository, user-initiated workflows, and automated schedules.
