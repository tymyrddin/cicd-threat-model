# Pipeline-based access controls

Pipeline-based access controls (PBAC) grant or deny access to resources and systems inside and outside the execution 
environment. Pipeline execution nodes use these to perform various actions. 

If malicious code enters the pipeline, adversaries can exploit improperly configured PBAC or PBAC vulnerabilities to 
abuse pipeline permissions to move laterally in or outside the CI/CD system.
