# Database

The aim of database CI tools is to bring the same integration and deployment best practices to the database and enable 
SQL codes to flow through the software release pipeline, synchronised with application code: Database Development Tools,
Database Release Automation Tools, Application Release Automation Tools, and Test Data Management Tools.

That's a lot of tools for storing database changes as scripts in version control and managing these changes in the same 
way as application changes.
