# Poisoned pipeline execution

Poisoned pipeline execution (PPE) is a technique that enables adversaries to poison the CI pipeline. 

The technique abuses permissions in [source code management (SCM)](../assets/scm-access.md) repositories to manipulate the 
build process. It involves injecting malicious code or commands into the build pipeline configuration, poisoning the 
pipeline to run malicious code during the build process.
